    # Overview

    Welcome to the _Bullish Trading API_ documentation!

    This documentation provides resource descriptions and endpoints usage instructions for the API.

    The API:
    - follows [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) conventions
    - has the base URL `api.exchange.bullish.com` (unless one of the sandbox environments is being used)
    - has endpoints under the below categories:
      - Authenticated endpoints for private client data e.g. [Get Orders](#get-/orders) endpoint
      - Non-authenticated endpoints for public data e.g. [Get Markets](#get-/markets) endpoint
    - uses bearer-based authentication
    - enforces a blanket rate limit across all requests
    - may add new fields to existing response payloads. Please do not use strict deserialisation as it may cause compatibility issues.
    
    # Code Examples
    
    Find further code examples at - https://github.com/bullish-exchange
    
    # FIX API
    
    The FIX API is available to institutional clients and is only accessible through a AWS or GCP private connection:
    - AWS PrivateLink
      - It provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS service without exposing your traffic to the public internet. 
      Bullish will provide the published service IDs for this service. You will be able to connect to our FIX service endpoint once the connection has been successfully established.
    - GCP Private Service Connect
      - It allows customers to access managed services privately from inside their VPC network.
      Bullish will provide the published service IDs for this service. You will be able to connect to our
      FIX service endpoint once the connection has been successfully established.
    
    
    For more details please refer to the full specification:
    - [Bullish FIX Protocol Specification](../../../fix-api/Bullish%20FIX%20Protocol%20Specification%20v1.0.4.pdf) 
    - [Bullish FIX Protocol Dictionary](../../../fix-api/fix-dictionary.xml)
    
    
    # Exchange Time

    All timestamps are specified in [EPOCH time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

    # Pagination Support

    If specified in the API documentation, an endpoint may return cursor paginated responses. Default page size is 25.

    There are 4 special query parameters used to control the pagination behaviour.
    - `_pageSize` can be one of `5, 25, 50, 100`, default value is `25`
    - `_metaData` can be false/true, if false the links are NOT part of the response. explicitly set `_metaData=true` to guarantee links are returned.
    - `_nextPage` cursor to the next page. It is provided in the paginated response when `_metaData=true`.
    - `_previousPage` cursor to the previous page. It is provided in the paginated response when `_metaData=true`.

    The paginated data is returned in the following wrapped format with generated links to the previous and next pages:
    ```json
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "averageFillPrice": null,
          "baseFee": "0.00000000",
          "createdAtDatetime": "2018-11-18T00:00:00.000Z",
          "createdAtTimestamp": "1639464207402",
          "handle": null,
          "margin": false,
          "orderId": "390755652232282113",
          "price": "8520.7000",
          "quantity": "1.00000000",
          "quantityFilled": "0.00000000",
          "quoteFee": "0.0003",
          "side": "BUY",
          "status": "OPEN",
          "statusReason": "Open",
          "statusReasonCode": "6001",
          "stopPrice": null,
          "symbol": "BTCUSD",
          "timeInForce": "GTC",
          "type": "LMT"
        },
        ...
      ],
      "links": {
        "next": "/trading-api/v1/orders?_pageSize=5&symbol=BTCUSD&_nextPage=Mjk3NzM1MzQ5NDI0NjIwMDMy",
        "previous": "/trading-api/v1/orders?_pageSize=5&symbol=BTCUSD&_previousPage=Mjk3NzM1Mzg3NzQ3OTc1Njgw"
      }
    }
    ```


    # Filtering Support
    
    - If specified in the API documentation, an endpoint may support filters on specific fields and values e.g. `GET /orders?status=OPEN`     
    - Only fields returned in an API response may be used as filter parameters. What you see is what you query on and by.
    - For the fields in the API response usable as filter parameters, please consult the API endpoint of interest.
    - Datetime and timestamp filters require additional keywords from this list - `[ gte, lte, gt, lt ]`. A few examples are provided below.
      - `/trading-api/v1/trades?createdAtTimestamp[gte]=1686447835000` queries for trades with `createdAtTimestamp` 
        greater than or equal to `1686447835000`.
      - `/trading-api/v1/trades?createdAtDatetime[gte]=2023-04-06T00:00:00.000Z&createdAtDatetime[lte]=2023-06-07T00:00:00.000Z` 
        queries for trades with `createdAtDatetime` greater than or equal to `2023-04-06T00:00:00.000Z` but less than or equal to `2023-06-07T00:00:00.000Z`
    - By design, pagination query parameters start with an underscore. This differentiates them from filter query parameters e.g. `GET /orders?status=OPEN&_pageSize=25`

    # Rate Limits
    
    ## Rate Limits per IP address
    
    Each IP address is subject to a blanket rate limit of 500 requests per 10 seconds (approximately 50 requests per second).
    If an IP address is rate limited, the http response status code will be `429 Too Many Requests` and the IP address
    is blocked from making any requests for 60 seconds.

    ## Global Rate Limit
    
    The global rate limit is an additional rate limit specific to the exchange. It is used to help limit the flow of orders into the exchange. It affects all clients fairly. 
    When the global rate limit is breached the `x-ratelimit-global-breach` header value will be set to `true` else `false`.
    
    ## Rate Limits per API category

    In addition, API endpoints denoted by `Ratelimited: True` in the description are also subject to rate limits.
    e.g. [Create Order](#post-/orders). The API endpoints fall under the below categories. The rate limit for each category is *independently* applied.
    
    - Unauthenticated endpoints, rate limited at 50 requests per second.
    - Authenticated `/orders` endpoints, rate limited at 50 requests per second.
    - Other Authenticated endpoints, rate limited at 50 requests per second.
    
    ## Rate Limits Info
    
    When rate limits are not exceeded, the http response header of the API endpoint called will contain the below:
    - `x-ratelimit-limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed for the specific API category within time period.
    - `x-ratelimit-remaining`: Remaining number of requests allowed for the specific API category within time period.
    - `x-ratelimit-reset`: The next time period in which `x-ratelimit-remaining` is reset back to the maximum allowed for the specific API category.
    - `x-ratelimit-global-breach`: true/false, indicating whether the global limit has been breached.

    ## Exceeding Rate Limits
    When rate limits are exceeded, the API endpoint will return the http response status code `429 Too Many Requests` and the http response body will be:
    ```json
      {
        "errorCode": 96000,
        "errorCodeName": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
        "message": "Rate limit exceeded"
      }
    ```

    ## Exceeding The Global Rate Limit
    When the global rate limit is exceeded, the API endpoint will return the http response status code `429 Too Many Requests` and the http response body will be:
    ```json
      {
        "errorCode": 96001,
        "errorCodeName": "GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
        "message": "Global rate limit exceeded"
      }
    ```

    ## Increasing Rate Limits
    
    Bullish has a tiered rate limit offering based on volume. 
    
    |                   | Default       | 30-Day Volume between $1B USD and $2B USD | 30-Day Volume over $2B USD |
    | ----------------- |-------------- |------------------------------------------ |--------------------------- |
    | Cloudflare        | 50 msgs/sec   | same as default                           | same as default            |
    | Cloudflare Bypass | 100 msgs/sec  | up to 200 msgs/sec                        | up to 500 msgs/sec         |
    
    For more information on increasing your rate limits, please reach out to your sales representative.
    
    ## Obtaining Your Rate Limit Token
    
    Each trading account has a unique rate limit token that can be obtained by querying [Get Trading Accounts](#get-/accounts/trading-accounts).
    The rate limit token must be provided in the HTTP request header `BX-RATELIMIT-TOKEN` to enjoy higher tiers of rate limits 
    else the default of 50 msgs/sec is applied.

    # Price And Quantity Precision
    
    A market consists of two assets, namely base asset and quote asset.
    For instance, the `BTCUSD` market has `BTC` as base asset and `USD` as quote asset.
    The price of a market is denominated in the quote asset, while the quantity is denominated in the base asset.
    For instance, the price in `BTCUSD` market is in `USD` while the quantity is in `BTC`. 
    Each asset has its own precision. For this, the below asset APIs can be queried.
    
    - The [Get Assets](#get-/assets) API endpoint for all supported asset symbols
    - The [Get Asset By Symbol](#get-/assets/-symbol-) API endpoint for a specific asset symbol
    
    The precision of an asset is the number of decimal places used to express its value in.
    For instance, the quantity in the market `BTCUSD` is in BTC. As BTC has a precision of 8, the quantity in `BTCUSD` has 8 decimal places.
    It follows that in order to express a quantity of 1 BTC in `BTCUSD` market, it has to be `1.00000000` BTC.
    
    Alternatively, the below market APIs can also be queried to obtain the price and quantity precisions for different markets.
    
    - The [Get Markets](#get-/markets) API endpoint for all supported market symbols
    - The [Get Market By Symbol](#get-/markets/-symbol-) API endpoint for a specific market symbol
    
    Following the logic outlined above, 
    - The precision for quantity is defined by the `basePrecision`
    - The precision for price is defined by `quotePrecision`


    # Numeric Identifier Contraints

    Numeric identifiers such as `nonce` and `handle` should not have leading zero's. For example `009990822212000000` is invalid but `9990822212000000` is valid.

    # Order timeInForce

    The order `timeInForce` can be set to the following values:
    - `GTC` - good until cancelled - the order is open forever unless fully filled or cancelled
    - `FOK` - fill or kill - if the order cannot immediately be filled in full it is cancelled
    - `IOC` - immediate or cancel - the order is immediately filled in full or in part and any remainder is cancelled
    
    # Error & Rejection Codes

    Details of `statusReasonCode` and `statusReason` can be referenced from [Error & Rejection Codes](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-docs/wiki/Error-&-Rejection-Codes) 

    # Authentication

    The API uses bearer based authentication. A JWT token is valid for 24 hours only. To generate a JWT token see - [Generate A JWT Token](#overview--generate-a-jwt-token)

    # How To Send Authenticated Requests

    To send an authenticated request, you must follow these steps:
    1. [Generate An API Key](#overview--generate-an-api-key)
    2. [Get Your Bullish Account Id](#overview--get-your-bullish-account-id)
    3. [Add Authenticated Request Header](#overview--add-authenticated-request-header)

    ## Generate An API Key

    A prerequisite to generate API keys is to have a Bullish account. To generate an API key follow these steps:

    1. Log in into your Bullish account
    2. Click on your account initials at the upper right corner and then click **Settings**
    3. Click **API Keys** and then click **Add API Key**
    4. Select the API Key type, either Bullish or HMAC
    5. Enter a key name in the *Key Name* field and click *Generate API Key*

    ### Bullish API Key Notes

    - A Bullish API key is a public/private key pair used for EDDSA based signing of trading API requests
    - The private key is what you will use to sign your requests
    - From here on the:
      - public key will be referred to as `PUBLIC_KEY`
      - private key will be referred to as `PRIVATE_KEY`
    - For information about the format of keys please review [EOS Wallet Specification](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/v2.0/keosd/wallet-specification)
    - Always store your private keys in a secure medium as they are used to sign your requests. Do not share your private keys in any publicly accessible areas such as code repositories, client side code, or other vulnerable areas and make sure the keys are not shipped with your mobile or web apps.

    A Bullish API key additionally has a `metadata` string assoicated with it which is displayed along side the key.
    You must base64 decode the `metadata` to extract your `userId` (example follows). You will need the `userId` in the next step.
    Please note that the `accountId` field is deprecated, and will be removed along with `v1/users/login` API towards the end of Q2 2023. Clients should reference the `userId` field instead.
    Old `metadata` strings generated before the March 2023 upgrade will not contain the `userId` field; clients are advised to get the `metadata` from the Settings page on the UI again.

    ```shell
    echo eyJwdWJsaWNLZXkiOiJQVUJfUjFfNWNpVW52TW5rVThMOVBCWnZaa1BGcjhqdkRnUHpzcHhWNGlqOThIN1JqM1FSNzJyMkEiLCJhY2NvdW50SWQiOjIyMjAwMDAwMDAwMDAwNCwiY3JlZGVudGlhbElkIjoiMTAifQ== | base64 --decode
    {"publicKey":"PUB_R1_5ciUnvMnkU8L9PBZvZkPFr8jvDgPzspxV4ij98H7Rj3QR72r2A","userId":"12345","accountId":"12345","credentialId":"10"}
    ```
    
    ### HMAC API Key Notes
    
    - A HMAC API Key is a shared secret key that is used for HMAC based signing
    - Always store your HMAC secret in a secure medium as they are used to sign your requests
    - You do not need the `metadata` string to extract your `userId` like you would a Bullish API Key
    - HMAC API Keys can only be used for Trading on Bullish; the JWT generated using an HMAC API Key is only valid for trading endpoints.

    ## Add Authenticated Request Header

    Each authenticated request must include a `Authorization` header:
      - `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`

    The JWT is valid for 24 hours.

    ### Bullish API Key
    To generate/get a JWT token for a Bullish API Key you will need to perform the following request:

    #### POST /trading-api/v2/users/login

    - Body
      - `publicKey` - bullish account public key
      - `userId` - bullish user id corresponding to the metadata
      - `signature` - signed JSON string encoding of `loginPayload`, see the code sample for how to get it
      - `expirationTime` - epoch timestamp in seconds that is 5 minutes in the future
      - `nonce` - epoch timestamp in seconds; note this login API nonce has no connection to the orders API nonce
      - `biometricsUsed` - set to `false`
      - `sessionKey` - set to `null`

    ```json
    {
      "publicKey": "<PUBLIC_KEY>",
      "signature": "<SIGNATURE>",
      "loginPayload": {
        "userId": "100008771"
        "nonce": 1638776636,
        "expirationTime": 1638776936,
        "biometricsUsed": false,
        "sessionKey": null
      }
    }
    ```

    - Response

    ```json
    {
      "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>",
      "token": "<JWT_TOKEN>"
    }
    ```

    #### POST /trading-api/v1/users/login (Deprecated - the endpoint will be removed towards the end of Q2 2023)

    - Body
      - `publicKey` - bullish account public key
      - `accountId` - bullish account id corresponding to the metadata
      - `signature` - signed JSON string encoding of `loginPayload`, see the code sample for how to get it
      - `expirationTime` - epoch timestamp in milliseconds that is 5 minutes in the future
      - `nonce` - epoch timestamp in milliseconds; note this login API nonce has no connection to the orders API nonce
      - `biometricsUsed` - set to `false`
      - `sessionKey` - set to `null`

    ```json
    {
      "publicKey": "<PUBLIC_KEY>",
      "signature": "<SIGNATURE>",
      "loginPayload": {
        "accountId": "100008771"
        "nonce": 1638776636,
        "expirationTime": 1638776936,
        "biometricsUsed": false,
        "sessionKey": null
      }
    }
    ```

    - Response

    ```json
    {
      "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>",
      "token": "<JWT_TOKEN>"
    }
    ```

    See [generate JWT](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/generate_jwt.py) for a sample Python script.
    
    ### HMAC API Key
    To generate/get a JWT token for a HMAC API Key you will need to perform the following request:
    
    #### GET /trading-api/v1/users/hmac/login
    
    - Response
    
    ```json
    {
      "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>",
      "token": "<JWT_TOKEN>"
    }
    ```
    
    You will need to provide a series of headers along with the request in order to successfully generate a JWT token.
    
    - `BX-TIMESTAMP` - number of milliseconds since EPOCH
    - `BX-NONCE` - client side incremented 64-bit unsigned integer
    - `BX-PUBLIC-KEY` - Public key for the HMAC Key being used to generate the JWT
    - `BX-SIGNATURE` - The signed message related to the login request. Outlined below
    
    To sign the login request for an HMAC API Key login we will need to construct a string that concatenates the following fields:
    - timestamp - value provided for the `BX-TIMESTAMP` header
    - nonce - value provided for the `BX-NONCE`
    - request method - `GET`
    - request path - `/trading-api/v1/users/hmac/login`
    
    See [generate JWT](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/generate_jwt.py) for a sample Python script.
    
    ## Logout using a JWT Token
    Users can better manage their sessions by logging out of unused sessions. This can be done by calling the `GET /trading-api/v1/users/logout` endpoint with the JWT Token in the header - see [Add Authenticated Request Header](#overview--add-authenticated-request-header).
    
    ## Construct The BX-NONCE Header

    The header `BX-NONCE` value is a unique client-side 64-bit unsigned integer. It has the following characteristics:

    - Each request the client sends how have incrementing `BX-NONCE` value
    - To prevent a client to send the max value of a 64-bit unsigned integer and thus immediately exhaust all unique nonces
    the exchange will only accept a nonce within a specified range
    - The lower and upper bounds of the current nonce range are specified by nonce endpoint e.g. `GET /nonce`
    - The nonce range is updated daily
    - The nonce `lowerBound` is the start of day EPOCH timestamp in micro seconds
    - The nonce `upperBound` is the end of day EPOCH timestamp in micro seconds

    ## Construct The Command You Want To Send

    Each authenticated request contains a `<COMMAND>` to be executed by the API.
    A `<COMMAND>` has the following properties:

      - A `<COMMAND>` is JSON encoded
      - Every field in the JSON payload must have a value. Use `null` to represent the absence of a value
      - The fields must be specified and encoded in the order presented in this documentation

    Find below two `<COMMAND>` examples:
    1. [Create Spot Order](#overview--create-spot-order-example)
    2. [Create Margin Order](#overview--create-margin-order-example)
    2. [Cancel Order](#overview--cancel-order-example)

    ### Create Spot Order Example

    To create a Spot buy limit order:
    - for the BTCUSD market
    - at a price of `55071.5000`
    - for a quantity of `1.87000000`
    - with a time-in-force of `GTC` (good till cancelled)

    The COMMAND would be constructed like below:

    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "<TIMESTAMP>",
      "nonce": "<NONCE>",
      "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>",
      "command": {
        "commandType": "V2CreateOrder",
        "handle": null,
        "symbol": "BTCUSD",
        "type": "LMT",
        "side": "BUY",
        "price": "55071.5000",
        "stopPrice": null,
        "quantity": "1.87000000",
        "timeInForce": "GTC",
        "allowMargin": false,
        "tradingAccountId": "111234567890" 
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Create Margin Order Example
    
    With reference to the same payload in [Create Spot Order](#overview--create-spot-order-example), setting the field `allowMargin` to `true` will make it a margin order.
    
    Documentation is available [here](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-docs/blob/master/src/trading-api/next/v2/websocket-private-data-update-messages-for-borrowers.pdf) on what happens in the event of liquidation.

    ### Cancel Order Example

    To cancel a buy limit order:
    - for the BTCUSD market
    - where the `orderId` is `390755251743358977`

    The COMMAND would be constructed like below:

    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "<TIMESTAMP>",
      "nonce": "<NONCE>",
      "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>"
      "command": {
        "commandType": "V2CancelOrder",
        "orderId": "390755251743358977",
        "handle": null,
        "symbol": "BTCUSD",
        "tradingAccountId": "111234567890"
      }
    }
    ```
    ### Add Amm instruction 
    
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "1621490985000",
      "nonce": "123456789",
      "authorizer": "03E02367E8C900000500000000000000",
      "command": {
        "commandType": "V2AddLiquidity",
        "symbol": "BTCUSD",
        "baseQuantity": "0.00000000",

    ## Construct The BX-SIGNATURE Header

    Set the `BX-SIGNATURE` header to the value resulting from signing the `<COMMAND>`.

    Before signing the `<COMMAND>` string remove any spaces and newline characters.

    The resulting value is also referred to as the request signature. Each component of the signature is detailed below:
      - `<TIMESTAMP>`: number of milliseconds since EPOCH
      - `<NONCE>`: client side incremented 64-bit unsigned integer
      - `<AUTHORIZER>`: JWT authorizer you obtain along with the [JWT token](#overview--generate-a-jwt-token)
      - `<COMMAND>`: the command which is sent in the request payload, JSON encoded

    #### How To Sign - Bullish API Key
    
    To obtain the signature:

    1. Encode the request JSON payload, also referred to as body, with the SHA-256 hash function and take the hexdigest
    2. Sign the hexdigest from step 1 with ECDSA P-256 using your `<PRIVATE_KEY>`
    3. Various signing examples can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/bullish-exchange)
    
    #### How To Sign - HMAC API Key
    
    To obtain the signature:
    
    1. Encode the request JSON payload, also referred to as body, with the SHA-256 hash function and take the hexdigest
    2. Sign the hexdigest from step 1 with your HMAC Secret Key.
    
    See [sign a request with HMAC](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/create_order_hmac_v2.py) for a sample Python script.

    ## Fetch Trading Account Ids
    
    Trading Account Ids may be required by some endpoints. They can be fetched from [Get All Trading Accounts](#get-/accounts/trading-accounts).
    
    See an API example [Here](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/get_trading_accounts.py).

    ## Send The HTTP Authenticated Request

    See [create an order](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/create_order.py) for a sample Python script.

    ## How To Ensure The Order Of *Create Order* or *Cancel Order* Requests

    To ensure the order of the *create order* or *cancel order* requests,
    you must wait for an acknowledgement response which will contain the `orderId`
    generated on the server side.
    Also remember that the `nonce` parameter, for these two requests, must be a
    unique increasing integer value.

    For example, let us assume the following:
    * You sent 10 *create order* requests in a row without waiting for an `orderId`
    * The `nonce` increases with each request sent and thus
    * The `nonce` is unique for each request

    Because the requests received by the Bullish exchange are processed in parallel
    the following two possible scenarios can happen:
    * *happy scenario* which has a small chance to occur: all 10 requests are
    processed in the exact order sent by the client, no error, all great and you
    are happy
    * *unhappy scenario* which has a higher chance to occur: the requests are not
    processed in the exact order sent by you, because the requests might arrive at the
    bullish processing server at different times and thus the validations
    of the `nonce` for each request take place at random times. Because of that all
    the requests that are validated and have the `nonce` higher than the latest
    valid `nonce` will be accepted as valid and the ones which have the `nonce`
    smaller than the last valid `nonce` will be considered invalid and dropped.
    In the worse case scenario the request with the highest `nonce`, the 10th request
    you sent, is validated first, and the rest of the 9 requests will fail the
    validation because they have the `nonce` smaller than the 10th.
    Also if some requests are failing because of some other errors, e.g. incorrect
    inputs or internal error, you will not know because you did not wait for the
    acknowledgement from the server side for each request you sent.

    If you wait the acknowledgement from the server side you ensure the order of
    the requests you sent and you can also verify the status of the order(s) you
    created or cancelled.
    
    ## How To Enable Out-Of-Order Processing of Order Requests
    The header `BX-NONCE-WINDOW-ENABLED` is a string representation of a boolean value which enables out-of-order 
    processing of *Create Order* or *Cancel Order* requests up to a window size of 100 from the highest previously used
    `nonce` value (inclusive).
    
    The `nonce` parameter is required to be both unique and incremental, but setting `BX-NONCE-WINDOW-ENABLED` to `true` 
    loosens this requirement such that the `nonce` is only required to be `unique`. For example, the client is able to 
    send `nonce` values from `1...100` in any order and all the values will be valid.   

    # WebSockets

    Connection request to the web-socket uses bearer based authentication similar to our HTTP authenticated requests.
    To generate a JWT token see - [Generate A JWT Token](#overview--generate-a-jwt-token). Each web-socket exposes a set of
    topics that can be subscribed to.

    ## Servers
      - `wss://api.exchange.bullish.com` - PRODUCTION
      - `wss://registered.api.exchange.bullish.com` - PRODUCTION (Cloudflare Bypass)
      - `wss://api.simnext.bullish-test.com` - SANDBOX
      - `wss://registered.api.simnext.bullish-test.com` - SANDBOX (Cloudflare Bypass)

    ## Max Open WebSocket Connections
    
    Each WebSocket category has a maximum number of open connections. Once it is reached, new WebSocket requests will be rejected. 
    The WebSocket connections fall under the below categories.
    
    - Unauthenticated WebSockets, maximum of 100 open connections per IP address.
    - Authenticated WebSockets, maximum of 10 open connections per API key.
    
    ## Send A Message Over The Web Socket

    Messages sent by the client to the server over a web-socket follows the
    [JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification). The server then returns a response following
    the same JSON-RPC 2.0 format. The `id` field sent by the client will be included in the response, allowing the
    client to map the server's responses to the messages sent by the client. The client ensures the uniqueness of the
    `id` field.

    Find below the message types accepted by the web-socket:
      1. [Subscription Message](#overview-subscribe-to-a-topic)
      2. [Keepalive Ping Message](#overview-keep-web-socket-open)

    ### Subscribe To A Topic

    Subscribe to receive a snapshot of your existing data and subsequently receive updates.

    Two types of subscription:
      1. Subscribe by `<TOPIC>`
      2. Subscribe by `<TOPIC>` and `<SYMBOL>`

    Message fields:
      - `<TOPIC>`: subscription topic
      - `<SYMBOL>`: market symbol
      - `<COMMAND_ID>`: unsigned long value

    The subscription message would be constructed like below:

    Subscribe by `<TOPIC>`
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "type": "command",
      "method": "subscribe",
      "params": {
          "topic": "<TOPIC>",
      },
      "id": "<COMMAND_ID>"
    }
    ```

    Subscribe by `<TOPIC>` and `<SYMBOL>`
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "type": "command",
      "method": "subscribe",
      "params": {
          "topic": "<TOPIC>",
          "symbol": "<SYMBOL>",
      },
      "id": "<COMMAND_ID>"
    }
    ```

    Sample subscription message:
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "type": "command",
      "method": "subscribe",
      "params": {
          "topic": "orders"
      },
      "id": "1611082473000"
    }
    ```

    Find below the available `<TOPIC>`:
      1. [Market Data Web Socket](#overview--market-data-websocket)
      2. [Private Data Web Socket](#overview--private-data-websocket)


    ### Keep Web Socket Open

    Keep the web-socket connection open by sending keepalive ping messages periodically.
    The web-socket closes automatically after 5 minutes.


    The keepalive ping message would be constructed like below:

    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "type": "command",
      "method": "keepalivePing",
      "params": {},
      "id": "<COMMAND_ID>"
    }
    ```


    ## Receive A Message From The Web Socket

    JSON-RPC responses are of the following format:

    Success responses
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "1650865877698",
      "result": {
        "responseCode": "200",
        "responseCodeName": "OK",
        "message": "Successfully subscribed"
      }
    }
    ```

    Error responses
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "1650865877698",
      "error": {
        "code": "-32602",
        "errorCode": "29013",
        "errorCodeName": "INVALID_TOPIC_ERROR",
        "message": "'a-random-topic' is not a valid topic"
    }
    ```

    - `code`: [JSON-RPC 2.0 error code](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
    - `responseCode`/`errorCode`: unique ID for response/error code
    - `responseCodeName`/`errorCodeName`: unique name for response/error code
    - `message`: textual description of the `responseCode`/`errorCode`


    Snapshot responses are of the following format:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "snapshot",
      "dataType": "<DATA_TYPE>",
      "data": [ { <TOPIC_RESPONSE> } ]
    }
    ```

    Update responses are of the following format:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "update",
      "dataType": "<DATA_TYPE>",
      "data": { <TOPIC_RESPONSE> }
    }
    ```

    Error responses are of the following format:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "error",
      "dataType": "V1TAErrorResponse",
      "data": {
        "errorCode": <ERROR_CODE>,
        "errorCodeName": "<ERROR_CODE_NAME>",
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Hybrid OrderBook WebSocket (unauthenticated)
    **Route**
    - `/trading-api/markets/{symbol}/orderbook/hybrid`
    - `/trading-api/v2/market-data/orderbook/hybrid/{symbol}?depth={depth}&aggregationFactor={aggregationFactor}`
    
    **Additional notes**: 
    - Allowable depths - `[ 10, 50, 100, 200 ]`.
    - Allowable aggregation factors - `[ 1, 5, 10 ]`.
    - This endpoint does not require subscriptions.

    On connection, the client receives a snapshot of the current hybrid orderbook with default depth of 10 (unless specified otherwise). 
    Subsequently, if the orderbook moves, the client then receives a conflated update of the hybrid orderbook periodically 
    at 300ms with standard ingress and at 100ms with Cloudflare bypass. If there is a sequence number mismatch between the 
    conflated update and the snapshot, the server disconnects the client with the following error message - 
    `4003 (Try Again, sequence number miss-match between snapshot and updates)`.

    #### Maintaining Hybrid OrderBook
    1. Connect to hybrid orderbook WebSocket API.
    2. Receive initial snapshot message.
    3. Record sequence number and create orderbook.
    4. Compare current sequence number with that of new message. If sequence number is out of order, reconnect.
    5. Receive update messages of price levels with new absolute quantity and update orderbook.
       If quantity is 0, price level is removed.
    6. Receive a subsequent snapshot message and reset existing orderbook. Create orderbook with new price levels.

    See [connect to hybrid orderbook web-socket](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/l2_orderbook_web_socket.py) for a sample Python script.
    
    ### Anonymous Trades WebSocket (unauthenticated)
    **Route**
    - `/trading-api/v1/market-data/trades/{symbol}`

    **Note**: This endpoint does not require subscriptions.

    On connection, the client receives a snapshot of the latest 100 trades, in descending order. Subsequently,
    the client receives real-time updates of trades that have been executed. If the `tradeId` of an incoming update is 
    smaller than that of a previously received update, then the `tradeId` is out of order. Terminate the 
    web-socket connection and reconnect.
